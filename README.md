## 📁 Project Structure

### 🔹 `linear_regression/`
Contains:
- `single_variable/`: Implements simple linear regression using gradient descent.
- `multi_variable/`: Predicts salary based on multiple features using matrix operations.
- `basic/`: A basic linear regression example with CSV data and visualization.

### 🔹 `gradient_descent/`
Visualizes how the gradient descent algorithm minimizes a cost function using an animated plot and simple numeric updates.

### 🔹 `vigenere_cipher/`
A text encryption tool using the classical Vigenère cipher. Accepts plaintext and a keyword to encrypt/decrypt messages securely.

### 🔹 `password_generator/`
Generates secure, random passwords using customizable character sets (letters, digits, symbols). Great for learning randomization and string handling.
