# Linear Regression Projects

This directory contains two simple projects demonstrating **Linear Regression** in Python, implemented from scratch using NumPy and Matplotlib.

## 📁 Folders

### 1. `basic/`  
A single-variable linear regression example using a dataset of test scores based on study hours.

- `test_scores.csv`: Dataset  
- `linear_regression.py`: Core script using gradient descent and plotting results

### 2. `multi_variable/`  
A multiple-variable linear regression model to predict employee salaries based on experience, test score, and interview score.

- `hiring.csv`: Dataset  
- `multi_variable.py`: Script that performs multivariable regression with prediction

## 🧠 Topics Covered

- Data preprocessing and normalization  
- Gradient descent algorithm  
- Mean squared error (MSE) as cost function  
- Visualization of regression line  
- Multi-feature input handling

## 🚀 How to Run

Navigate to the folder you want to run and use:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib
python linear_regression.py  # or multi_variable.py

📌 Notes
No external ML libraries like scikit-learn are used.

These are for educational purposes to learn how regression works under the hood.
