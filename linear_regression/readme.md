# 📈 Linear Regression on Per Capita Income in Canada

This project demonstrates a simple linear regression model using Python to predict Canada's per capita income based on historical data.

## 📁 Files Included

- `canada_per_capita_income.csv` – Dataset of Canada's per capita income from 1970 to 2016.
- `linear_regression.py` – Python script that builds and runs the regression model.
- `linear.ipynb` – Jupyter Notebook version with explanations and visualizations.

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- scikit-learn

## 📚 Concepts Covered

- Reading and exploring CSV data
- Visualizing trends with scatter plots
- Training a simple linear regression model
- Making predictions and plotting the regression line

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/IS-HAQ46/learning-projects.git
   cd learning-projects/linear_regression
   ```

2. Install required libraries (if not already installed):
   ```
   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib scikit-learn
   ```

3. Run the script:
   ```
   python linear_regression.py
   ```

   Or open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```
   jupyter notebook linear.ipynb
   ```

## 📊 Example

Predicting per capita income for the year 2020:
```
Input: 2020
Predicted Output: ₹XXXX.XX
```

The notebook also shows a scatter plot with the regression line.

## 🌱 Future Ideas

- Add model performance metrics (e.g., R² score)
- Try polynomial regression
- Deploy using Flask or Streamlit
